App: Ravenous
Created By: Greg Bruce (https://github.com/GBruce82/Ravenous) in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Codecademy's "Build Front-End Web Apps" intensive course (https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-frontend-web-apps-from-scratch).

This program is 'mostly' a restaurant search app although it will search for non-food related results such as "Auto Parts".  It is built to work in conjunction with Yelp! and as such requires you obtain a Yelp Api Key.

Per the React_README this app was bootstrapped using "Create React App" (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See the "React_README.md" for more information and specifics about the the "Create React App" functionality.

To run my Ravenous App:
1. Pull the code to your local machine

2. Create a ".config.json" file in "/src" with this json format:
  {
    "yelpApiKey" : "insert your Yelp Api Key here, inside the quotation marks with no comma or semi-colon at the end"
  }

3. From the command line/terminal, run "npm install" anywhere in your Ravenous folder.  It will probably take a moment to complete; there is a lot to be installed.

4. Once you have control over the terminal again:
  a. From the command line/terminal, run "npm start" anywhere in your Ravenous folder
  b. It should launch the app in your browser

5. In the "Search Businesses" bar enter a restaurant type (Chinese, Pizza, etc.)

6. In the "Where?" search bard enter a "city, state" where you want to eat or explore

7. Click on the "Let's Go" button, see your results, pick your restaurant and ENJOY!
